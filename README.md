## Running Code

### AWS Credentials

In order to use cdk you need to have an AWS credential, many ways to do this...

**Through AWS Portal (Reccomended)**

go to your AWS Portal and select **Access Keys** for pipeline account

Copy option 1 into terminal

ex:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= xxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= xxxxx
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN= xxxxx
```

##### 1. Start the app

   ```
    ./run.sh
   ```

##### 1.1 Manually running simulator (in case run.sh doesn't work)

   ```bash
    npx expo run:ios or npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
